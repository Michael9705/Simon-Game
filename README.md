# Simon-Game Description:

The game is implemented in JavaScript with jQuery Library to simplify DOM manipulation. EventListener interface is the main technique used in this game to create user experience. The JS file simulats pressing button and sound effects, and compares user input pattern and game pattern to determine if user passes the current level game.
